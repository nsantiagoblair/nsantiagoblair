# 👋 Hey, I'm Nick

I'm a data engineer in fintech based in Guildford, UK. I build scalable, AWS-based data systems and occasionally dive into AI and LLMs on the side.

## 💼 What I Do

- 🧱 Build and maintain cloud-native data pipelines on AWS  
- ⚡ Work with large-scale batch and streaming data using PySpark and Kafka  
- 🧠 Experiment with AI tools like Vercel AI SDK and OpenAI  
- 🧪 Currently exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation and custom LLM agents  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
```bash
Languages: Python, SQL, TypeScript
Data: PySpark, Airflow, Kafka, Redshift, Athena
Cloud: AWS (S3, Lambda, Glue, ECS, CloudWatch)
Infra/Tools: Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions
AI/LLM: Vercel AI SDK, OpenAI API, Mastra, LangChain
Frontend: Reac Nativet, Next.js (for side projects)
```
## 🧪 Side Projects

- 🧙‍♂️ **Dungeon Master AI** — a custom LLM that reads books and runs TTRPG sessions  
- 🔍 **RAG Playground** — building out fast LLM prototypes with Supabase and AI SDK  
- 🎸 **Guitar side-quester** — shredding riffs between data pipelines and sometimes coding solos that only my compiler hears
